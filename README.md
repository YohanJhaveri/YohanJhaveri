## Hey there! 👋🏼

I'm a 21 year old React Developer and a co-founder at [studyfind.org](https://studyfind.org). 

I love exploring all areas of CS but some of my favorites are cryptography, game design and reinforcement learning. 

I also enjoy playing my acoustic guitar, designing logos and reading philosophy.
